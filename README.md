# 🚀 Interview App

## 📚 Introduction

The Interview App is a web application designed to streamline the interview process for both interviewers and candidates. With this app, interviewers can easily upload a .csv file containing topics and questions. The platform then displays topics and three random cards with questions based on the provided data. Candidates can select a card to reveal a randomly generated question within that specific topic, creating a dynamic and engaging interview experience.

## 🎯 Goals

1. Provide a platform for interviewers to upload questions and topics.
2. Allow interviewers to choose topics and generate random questions.
3. Enable a user-friendly interface for interviewers and candidates.
4. Provide a 'multiplayer' mode for online interviews.
